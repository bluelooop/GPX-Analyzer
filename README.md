# GPX Analyzer

**GPX Analyzer** is a Python library designed to process and analyze GPX (GPS Exchange Format) files, which are commonly
used to store GPS data from devices like fitness trackers, smartphones, and GPS devices. The library enables users to
load GPX data and extract useful information such as elevation, grades, elevation gain/loss, and other metadata. It is
particularly
useful for developers who need to work with GPS data for activities like hiking, cycling, or running.

## Features

- Parse and analyze GPX data with ease.
- Extract data such as waypoints, tracks, and routes.
- Provide statistics like distance, elevation, elevation gain/loss, grade.
- Visualize or further process the data for various applications.
